### Input: 
### Response: I had to make a difficult decision when I was working as a project manager at a construction company. I was in charge of a project that needed to be completed by a certain date in order to meet the client’s expectations. However, due to unexpected delays, we were not able to meet the deadline and so I had to make a difficult decision.

The project was eventually successfully completed and this was seen as a testament to my leadership and decision-making abilities..
